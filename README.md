# RVM_project_48
Project in ML Advanced HT19

Scope of the project (please indicate clearly which tasks account for the desirable grade higher than E) 
1. Implement the proposed methods (RVM), validate Tipping’s results on a toy problem. We will
implement the methods for some of the datasets used in the paper, and some new datasets. As
Tipping’s results show a less RVM superiority for classification problems, we limit the report to
classification problems.

Datasets to use:

##### Tippings
* Banana - 2d 
* Breast cancer - 9d
* German - 20d

Our own
* Heart
* Ringnorm

2. Deploy RVM on selected classification problems, and compare the results and interpretation to
SVM. Again, we will use some problems that the paper uses but also include other datasets (for
example, problems with higher dimensional input data). Higher grade.
3. Investigate scaling properties of RVMs (compare with SVMs)
a. Decrease datasets
b. See how the difference changes with smaller dataset, (e.g. linearly, exponentially?)
c. Discuss complexity
